AX Pro eliminates this gap with\nAI Supervision\n, enabling continuous evaluation and human-in-the-loop control that boosts accuracy, reliability, and compliance to near 99%.\nHow do experts control the chatbot?\nThrough the AX Pro Dashboard, experts can review conversation logs, adjust responses, and leave natural-language feedback. That feedback is learned immediately, so the chatbot continuously adapts to the expert’s tone, precision, and style.\nIs updating knowledge complicated?\nNot at all. Experts can upload FAQs, policy docs, or manuals directly. AX Pro automatically processes and updates its vectorized knowledge base—no separate retraining or engineering work required.\nWhich industries benefit most from AX Pro?\nAny field where precision and trust are essential—finance, healthcare, manufacturing, education, customer service. AX Pro ensures regulatory compliance and consistent brand communication across all touchpoints.\nWhat happens if the AI gives an incorrect answer?\nAX Pro’s live monitoring detects and flags inaccurate or risky responses in real time.

It ensures ultra-low latency, strong privacy, and full control over your AI operations.\nHow is TecAce’s On-Device LLM different from others?\nTecAce’s model is connected to our AI Supervision Platform, allowing developers to monitor, test, and optimize models remotely — even after deployment. You can track performance, identify issues, and push improvements while the model continues running locally on the device.\nCan it really be optimized and tested during development?\nYes. Through continuous integration with Supervision, the model undergoes testing and evaluation cycles during development. This feedback loop refines accuracy, latency, and user experience for each specific device environment.\nWhich LLMs can be used or customized?\nWe support leading open-source models such as Gemma, Llama, and Qwen, as well as others. Using fine-tuning, prompt engineering, and power optimization, TecAce adapts each model to the target hardware — balancing memory, speed, and battery consumption across smartphones, wearables, embedded systems, and automotive devices.\nWhat kind of AI functions does it support beyond text?\nIn addition to text-based reasoning, TecAce’s On-Device LLM integrates Speech-to-Text (STT), Text-to-Speech (TTS), and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) — enabling multimodal, voice-enabled, and knowledge-aware AI directly on the device.\nEN\nKO\nAI Supervision\nReal-Time Monitoring\nOverview\nLive Dashboards\nWhy It Matters\nGeneral\nAI Supervision\nAX Pro\nOn-device LLM\nUptime Monitoring\nSecure CMS\nWhat is TecAce’s Uptime Monitoring platform?\nIt’s a real-time observability and monitoring system designed for mission-critical APIs and infrastructure. The platform unifies logs, metrics, and traces across multiple clouds, helping teams detect, diagnose, and resolve issues before they affect users or revenue.\nHow does it differ from traditional monitoring tools?\nUnlike static dashboards or siloed tools, TecAce’s platform offers end-to-end observability across infrastructure, APIs, and microservices — including synthetic global testing that mimics real-user behavior. It combines proactive alerting with deep log analytics, giving operators predictive insight instead of reactive response.\nWhat kinds of systems and environments are supported?\nUptime Monitoring is multicloud-native, supporting AWS, GCP, Azure, and hybrid setups. It integrates seamlessly with popular monitoring stacks like Prometheus, OpenTelemetry, ELK, Grafana, and Fluentd, making it compatible with most enterprise infrastructures.\nHow does global synthetic testing work?\nThe system performs automated, simulated API calls and transactions from multiple geographic regions. These synthetic probes identify latency spikes, regional outages, or degraded services — providing early warning long before end-users experience downtime.\nWho benefits most from TecAce’s Uptime Monitoring?\nIt’s ideal for enterprises and service providers running API-driven products — such as AI platforms, fintech systems, telecom networks, or retail operations. Any organization that values continuous availability and global performance insight can benefit from this platform.\nEN\nKO\nAI Supervision\nReal-Time Monitoring\nOverview\nLive Dashboards\nWhy It Matters\nGeneral\nAI Supervision\nAX Pro\nOn-device LLM\nUptime Monitoring\nSecure CMS\nWhat is TecAce’s Secure CMS?\nSecure CMS is an enterprise-grade headless content management platform built with security, privacy, and compliance at its core.
